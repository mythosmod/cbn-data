Acquiring non-human subjects, sadly, is a long and costly process, and research into this area is lacking.":"非常奇怪的是，在非人类的哺乳动物样品上使用XE037样品并不能令其产生复苏现象。遗憾的是，获取可用于的非人类测试对象的样品会是一个漫长而昂贵的过程，而且在这方面的研究十分匮乏。","After our curious results with testing XE037 on non-human mammals, we decided to introduce the substance to some of the insects which have found their way into the lab.  Horrifyingly, XE037 caused near-instant mutation and gigantism in the insects, and security intervention was required.":"在我们对非人哺乳动物进行XE037测试之后，我们决定将XE037对那些偶然闯进实验室的昆虫使用。可怕的是，XE037立刻令虫子产生了变异，同时变得巨大无比，为此我们不得不呼叫警卫。","Earlier conjecture that revivification occurred only in humans and insects was premature.  Exposure introduces a persistent, low level infection in all mammal subjects, but quickly enters a form of stasis and seems to go dormant.":"复苏只发生在人类和昆虫的早期猜想似乎并不正确。持续暴露在XE037中后，所有哺乳动物都受到了低水平感染，但很快进入稳定形态并且进入休眠。","The primary factor in determining revivification of mammalian subjects seems to be the amount of XE037 within the body at time of expiration.  Smaller mammals such as lab rats do not obtain this critical mass of XE037 before going dormant.  Larger canine subjects, however, do.":"影响哺乳动物复苏的主要因素似乎是在试验品体内XE037的剂量。小型哺乳动物，如实验室的大鼠在休眠前体内不能到达XE037临界质量，然而大型犬类却可以吸收到临界质量。","I swear they are talking to me.  No one believes me.  No one understands.

It seems that it occasionally displays a mutagenic property which manifests itself after termination of the subject, resulting in a striking variety in postmortem morphology.":"S37ZBE，即对XE037在惰性人类躯体的效力的特别研究，出现了可怕的结果。它似乎能产生一些基因变异个体，死后形态明显不同。","Incidence of post-mortem mutation seems to depend on several factors - leading candidates include type and amount of damage sustained leading to expiration, embedded foreign bodies at time of revivification, proximity to other revived individuals, and the body mass of the subject.":"死后基因变异的发生率似乎取决于几个因素 - 导致死亡的伤害类型和伤害持续时间，嵌入尸体的异物，附近其他尸体的基因变异以及尸体的体重参数。","Time also appears to play a large role in post-mortem revivification, as does sustained trauma insufficient to permanently disable the subject.  Sufficient amounts of trauma in short periods of time lead to deactivation of XE037, but smaller amounts over several days cause it to expand.":"时间似乎也在死后复活起很大的作用，比如持续而不充足的创伤并不足以使试验品永久失去行动力。在短时间内造成足量的创伤能让XE037失活，但持续几天少量的创伤反而会导致XE037扩散。","S37ZBE may be put on indefinite hold shortly.  Postmortem morphological changes have reached extreme levels; this morning one subject nearly doubled in size, acquiring enough strength to reduce a concrete wall to rubble.  It required a 6 man team, heavily armed, to re-terminate the subject.":"S37ZBE项目可能马上就会被无限期搁置。尸体解剖所显示的测试对象的形态变化已经达到极限水平；今天早上一个测试对象的体型近乎加倍，并且获得了足以推倒混凝土墙的巨大力量。需要整整六个人全副武装才能重新终结这个测试对象。","Jakobson insists that S37ZBE must continue, despite the extreme security and safety risks.  Nearly half of our security forces have been redirected to the S37ZBE project, simply to deal with the occasional escape of a subject.":"雅各布森仍然坚持要求S37ZBE项目必须继续下去，尽管这个项目存在着极大的安全风险。我们近一半的保安部队都被重新导向到了S37ZBE项目上，仅仅是为了能够处理偶尔逃脱的测试对象。","Jakobson was killed today by one of S37ZBE's subjects; ironic considering how hard he fought to keep the project active.

I'd say we got twenty decent men or women still here but our real strength comes from all of our business partners that are accustomed to doing whatever is needed to survive.":"难民们待在这里的一楼，直到他们其中有人试图透过装载区偷渡一个垂死之人。最后你猜怎么着……我们被惨叫声吵醒。大约有二十多人死在当晚。剩下的难民在隔天被放逐，一部分的人加入了拾荒者集团。我得说虽然我们只剩约20个可用的男女，但我们真正的力量来自于我们所有的事业伙伴以及做该做的事情来生存。","Guess it works for you...":"我猜它对你有用……","Had one guy pop in here a while back saying he had tried to drive into Syracuse after the outbreak.  Didn't even make it downtown before he ran into a wall of the living dead that could stop a tank.  He hightailed it out but claims there were several thousand at least.  Guess when you get a bunch of them together they end up making enough noise to attract everyone in the neighborhood.  Luckily we haven't had a mob like that pass by here.":"前阵子有一个来这的家伙说灾变后他曾试着开车进入雪城。还没到城区他就遇到一大群活死人，多的可以挡下坦克，更别说他那辆小破车了。他拼了命逃了出来，就他说至少有几千个丧尸。想想吧，把一堆丧尸扔在一起，它们就会制造出足以把所有东西吸引过来的噪声。幸运的是，我们这边没有那么大的尸潮。","Thanks for the tip.":"不错的消息，谢了！","Well, there is a party of about a dozen 'scavengers' that found some sort of government facility.  They bring us a literal truck load of jumpsuits, m4's, and canned food every week or so.  Since some of those guys got family here, we've been doing alright.  As to where it is, I don't have the foggiest of ideas.":"呃，有伙大概十几人的\"废土清道夫\"发现了一个政府建造的设施，他们每星期用上面印着字的卡车给我们运来一些囚服，几把M4以及一些罐头食品，因为那些家伙的家人都呆在这儿，所以待我们不错。至于那地方在哪，我可是一点都不清楚。","Thanks, I'll keep an eye out.":"谢谢。我会小心的。","I'm sorry, not a risk we are willing to take right now.":"对不起，我们宁愿保持现状，至少没有风险。","Fine...":"好吧……","There isn't a chance in hell!  We had one guy come in here with bloody fur all over his body... well I guess that isn't all that strange but I'm pretty sure whatever toxic waste is still out there is bound to mutate more than just his hair.":"根本没有一丝的机会！曾经有一个人来的时候全身都是天煞的毛！好吧，或许也没什么奇怪的，但那些有毒废料恐怕不仅仅让是他头发变异了这么简单。","Fine... *coughupyourscough*":"好吧……咳嗽咳嗽","Sorry, last thing we need is another mouth to feed.  Most of us lack any real survival skills so keeping our group small enough to survive on the food random scavengers bring to trade with us is important.":"不好意思，我们最不需要的就是多一双等着吃饭的碗筷。我们当中的大多数人没有真正的生存技能，废土清道夫带来交易的食物也没个准数，所以我倾向于保持团队的精简。","I'm sure I can do something to change your mind *wink*":"我相信有些东西可以让你回心转意 *眨眼*","I can pull my own weight!":"我可以照顾我自己！","I guess I'll look somewhere else...":"我想我还是到其他地方去看看……","Can't say we've heard much.  Most these shelters seemed to have been designed to make people feel safer... not actually aid in their survival.  Our radio equipment is utter garbage that someone convinced the government to buy, with no intention of it ever being used.  From the passing scavengers I've heard nothing but prime loot'n spots and rumors of hordes.":"我们能得到的情报的也不多。这些避难所大部分只是设计来让人们觉得更安心……而不是帮助他们存活下去。我们的无线电设备简直就像一坨屎，而这坨屎又是某个货劝说政府买下的，谁都没想到这些东西会有用到的一天。从路过的拾荒者那里我们打听不到太多东西，大部分都是拾荒点和尸潮的传言。","Hordes?":"尸潮？","Heard of anything better than the odd gun cache?":"有比牛叉的大枪上膛的声音更好听的吗？","Was hoping for something more...":"还以为有什么好东西……","Marshal...":"长官，你好。","Citizen...":"你好，公民。","Who are you?":"你是谁？","Is there any way I can join the 'Old Guard'?":"我可以加入\"旧世守护者\"吗？","Does the Old Guard need anything?":"旧世守护者需要什么吗？","I'm the region's federal liaison.  Most people here call us the 'Old Guard' and I rather like the sound of it.  Despite how things currently appear, the federal government was not entirely destroyed.  After the outbreak I was chosen to coordinate civilian and militia efforts in support of military operations.":"我是该地区的联邦政府联络官，在这里大多数人称呼我们：\"旧世守护者\"，我还是挺喜欢这个绰号的。尽管目前情况不容乐观，但是联邦政府并未因此为完全垮掉。疫病爆发之后我被选来协调平民和民兵以支援军队的军事行动。","So what are you actually doing here?":"那么你在这儿究竟在干什么？","Never mind...":"没关系……","I ensure that the citizens here have what they need to survive and protect themselves from raiders.  Keeping some form of law is going to be the most important element in rebuilding the world.  We do what we can to keep the 'Free Merchants' here prospering and in return they have provided us with spare men and supplies when they can.":"我确保平民能够得到需要的物资来从强盗手中保护自己。保持某种形式的法律，将是在重建世界时最重要的一点。我们尽我们所能来保持\"自由商会\"蓬勃发展。做为回报，他们尽可能的提供我们人力与物资。","Is there a catch?":"能说重点吗？","Anything more to it?":"还有什么？","Well... I was like any other civilian till they conscripted me so I'll tell it to you straight.  They're the best hope we got right now.  They are stretched impossibly thin but are willing to do what is needed to maintain order.  They don't care much about looters since they understand most everyone is dead, but if you have something they need... you WILL give it to them.  Since most survivors here have nothing they want, they are welcomed as champions.":"好吧……在守护者征召我之前，我和其他人一样不过是个平民百姓，因此我就对你直说了。他们是我们目前的最大希望。虽然他们现在力量薄弱，但他们会尽全力维持控制区内的秩序。他们不在乎拾荒者，因为他们明白大部分的人都死了，但是如果你有他们需要的东西……你 '理应' 给他们。这儿的大部分幸存者不会有他们想要的东西，因此他们受到英雄一般的欢迎。","Hmmm...":"呣……","There isn't much pushed out by public relations that I'd actually believe.  From what I gather, communication between the regional force commands is almost non-existent.  What I do know is that the 'Old Guard' is currently based out of the 2nd Fleet and patrols the Atlantic coast trying to provide support to the remaining footholds.":"现在公开渠道已经很难得到什么可信的消息了。据我所知，各区域势力之间的联系几乎已经全被阻断了。我唯一知道的是，\"旧世守护者\"目前依靠第二舰队，在大西洋沿岸巡逻，以支援他们仍在运作的据点。","The 2nd Fleet?":"第二舰队？","Tell me about the footholds.":"和我说说那些个据点。","I don't know much about how it formed but it is the armada of military and commercial ships that's floating off the coast.  They have everything from supertankers and carriers to fishing trawlers... even a few NATO ships.  Most civilians are offered a cabin on one of the liners to retire to if they serve as a federal employee for a few years.":"我不太了解它怎样组建起来的，只知道它是巡弋在外海的军事或者商业船只组成的舰队。他们从拖网渔船到超级油轮都有……甚至有一些北约组织的船。大部分撤离的平民愿意作为联邦雇员工作几年，而报酬则是舰队的一个客舱小隔间。","They may just be propaganda but apparently one or two cities were successful in 'walling themselves off.'  Around here I was told that there were a few places like this one but I couldn't tell you where.":"他们有可能只是在宣传，但显然的有一两个城市已经成功建成\"隔离区\"。这附近有人告诉我还有几个跟这里一样的地方，但是我不知道在哪。","You can't actually join unless you go through a recruiter.  We can usually use help though, ask me from time to time if there is any work available.  Completing missions as a contractor is a great way to make a name for yourself among the most powerful men left in the world.":"你必须透过招募人才能够真正加入。我们通常欢迎各种帮助，你可以时常来问我有没有活干。你完成的合约越多，你的名声就越容易被这些世上仅存最有实力的人了解。","I haven't done anything wrong...":"我什么坏事都没有干……","Any tips for surviving?":"有什么幸存的秘诀？","What would it cost to hire you?":"雇你需要什么代价？","I'm just a hired hand.  Someone pays me and I do what needs to be done.":"拿人钱财与人消灾！这样说你能明白不？","If you have to fight your way out of an ambush, the only thing that is going to save you is having a party that can return fire.  People who work alone are easy pickings for monsters and bandits.":"如果你想在被埋伏的情况下杀出一条路来，那么唯一能救得了你的办法就是有一群同伙与你一起还击，独自行走的人会被强盗或者怪物轻易干掉。","I suppose I should hire a party then?":"怎么着？我还要雇一帮人？","I'm currently waiting for a customer to return... I'll make you a deal though, $8,000 will cover my expenses if I get a small cut of the loot.

These deficiencies come in stages, so for example you won't go from perfectly good health into a full-blown scurvy in an instant. Any developing and on-going deficiencies will be reported in the character sheet. Deficiencies will inflict various penalties, but luckily they are always reversible, and multivitamin pills can help you to correct any deficiencies. You can also ingest too much vitamins, and that too can create problems. Be sure to have a balanced diet, or at least not a completely atrocious one. You can and should examine food items to view their nutritional facts.":"口渴比饥饿对角色的损害更为严重，但不平衡的饮食会让你患上维生素缺乏症。这些缺乏症状分多种阶段，举例来说就是你不会从健康状态瞬间变成败血症晚期。任何发展中的症状都在状态栏处显示。维生素缺乏会给予你多种惩罚，但是好消息是他们是可以被治愈的，混合维生素片可以治疗任何维生素缺乏症。另一方面，维生素过量也会给你带来问题。所以合理饮食非常重要，至少也别太偏食。你可以也应当在物品信息栏查看食物的营养成分。","Finding food in a city is usually easy; outside of a city, you may have to hunt. After killing an animal, stand over the animal's corpse and butcher it into small chunks of meat by pressing %s. You might also be able to forage for edible fruit or vegetables; to do it, find a promising plant and examine it. Likewise, you may have to drink water from a river or another natural source. To collect it, stand in shallow water and press %s. You'll need a watertight container to store it. Be forewarned that some sources of water aren't trustworthy and may produce diseased water. To make sure it's healthy, purify the water by boiling it or using water purifier before drinking.":"城市里的食物来源丰富，在城外你则需要去狩猎。杀死一只动物后，站在尸体上按\"%s\"键可以屠宰尸体。你也可以在植物上搜索找吃的。同样的，你可以从河流或者其他水源取水，站在浅水处按\"%s\"键可以搜集水资源。当然你还需要密闭的容器来盛放。不过要小心，不是所有水源都是可以饮用的，有的会让你得病。净化水，煮沸水或者用净水器都可以让水变干净。","Every 14 to 20 hours, you'll find yourself growing sleepy. If you do not sleep by pressing %s, you'll start suffering stat and movement penalties. You may not always fall asleep right away. Sleeping indoors, especially on a bed, will help.

Pain slows you down and reduces your stats, and finding a way to manage pain is an early imperative. The most common is drugs: aspirin, codeine, tramadol, oxycodone, and more are all great options. Be aware that while under the influence of many painkillers, the physiological side effects may slow you or reduce your stats.":"几乎任何的伤害都会让你的角色感到疼痛，而疼痛感会减少各项属性并延缓你的行动，所以从一开始你就要考虑如何应对这个问题。最简单的办法，就是服药：阿司匹林、可待因、曲马朵、羟考酮等都是很好的选择，但别忘了当你服用大量止痛剂之后，药效本身一样会让你的行动迟缓并削弱部分属性。","Note that most painkillers take a little while to kick in. If you take some oxycodone and don't notice the effects right away, don't start taking more -  you may overdose and die!":"需要注意的是大多数止疼药的生效需要时间，如果你服用了一些羟考酮但是没有立刻生效，请务必稍等片刻而不是急着再次服用，药物使用过量是会致命的！","Pain will also disappear with time, so if drugs aren't available and you're in a lot of pain, it may be wise to find a safe spot and simply rest for an extended period of time.":"即使不服药，随着时间的推移疼痛感也会逐渐消退，所以当你没有药物且全身疼痛的时候，最好能够找处安全的地方进行休息。","Another common class of drugs is stimulants. Stimulants provide you with a temporary rush of energy, increasing your movement speed and many stats (most notably intelligence), making them useful study aids. There are two drawbacks to stimulants: they make it more difficult to sleep and, more importantly, most are highly addictive. Stimulants range from the caffeine rush of cola to the more intense high of Adderall and methamphetamine.":"游戏中除了止痛药，还有各类兴奋剂。兴奋剂能够在短时间内提升角色的行动能力及各项属性。然而服用兴奋剂有两大注意事项：服用兴奋剂之后角色将很难入睡，并且兴奋剂很容易成瘾。游戏中的兴奋剂从可乐饮料中的咖啡因到安非他命和麻黄碱等都有。","Many drugs have a potential for addiction. Each time you consume such a drug there is a chance that you will grow dependent on it. Consuming more of that drug will increase your dependence. Effects vary greatly between drugs, but all addictions have only one cure; going cold turkey. The process may last for days and will leave you very weak, so try to do it in a safe area.":"许多药物都有一定的潜在上瘾性，每次当你服用某种药物，都有一定几率将来你会很难离开它，服用越多，瘾性越大。而上瘾之后戒断的唯一方法就是停止服用，并在接下来很长一段时间内不再服用，期间你会变得非常虚弱，所以请找个安全的地方进行脱瘾戒断。","If you are suffering from drug withdrawal, taking more of the drug will cause the effects to cease immediately, but may deepen your dependence.":"当你药瘾发作的时候，你会痛苦不堪，虽然再次用药会立刻解除这种痛苦，但下一次的药瘾会发作得更快。","Your character has a morale level, which affects you in many ways. The depressing post-apocalypse world is tough to deal with, and your mood will naturally decrease very slowly.":"你的角色有一个心情值的指标，它会在很多场合发生作用。独自身处后启示录时代、满目苍夷的世界之中是一件非常令人绝望的事情，你的心情会随着时间的推移逐渐低落。","There are lots of options for increasing morale; reading an entertaining book, eating delicious food, and taking recreational drugs are but a few options. Most morale-boosting activities can only take you to a certain level before they grow boring.":"当然游戏中也有不同的方式可以帮助你恢复心情值：读一本有趣的书、吃一些美味的食物或服用一些提神的药物等，只是这些手段也只能维持一段时间，而且重复使用之后的效率会越来越低。","There are also lots of ways for your morale to decrease, beyond its natural decay. Eating disgusting food, reading a boring technical book, killing a friendly NPC, or going through drug withdrawal are some prominent examples.":"与其相对的是你的身边有很多因素会降低你的心情值，除了自然衰退以外，吃一些难吃的食物、读一本枯燥的书、杀害友好的NPC以及药物脱瘾等等都是些显著例子。","Low morale will make you sluggish and unmotivated. If your morale drops very low, you won't be able to perform crafting at all. If you become sufficiently depressed, you will suffer stat penalties. Very high morale fills you with gusto and energy, and you will find yourself moving faster. At extremely high levels, you will receive stat bonuses.":"过低的心情值会让你的角色变得懒散及忧郁，具体表现为各项属性的降低，尤其是智力。如果你的心情值低落到一个非常低的程度时，甚至会导致角色的自杀。高心情值能让你充满干劲，你会发现自己行动更加迅速，而心情值特别高昂时，你会获得基础属性加成。","Morale is also responsible for ensuring you can learn effectively, via a mechanic referred to as 'focus'. Your focus level is a measure of how effectively you can learn. The natural level is 100, which indicates normal learning potential. Higher or lower focus levels make it easier or harder to learn from practical experience.":"心情值也会影响你的\"专注\"值，从而影响你的学习效率。你的专注值决定了你的学习效率。一开始你有100点专注值，更高或更低的专注值会使你获得学习效率的增益或惩罚。","Your focus level has a natural set point that it converges towards. When your focus is much lower - or higher - than this set point, it will change faster than when it is near the set point. Having high morale will raise the set point, and having low morale will lower the set point. Pain is also factored into the set point calculation - it's harder to learn when you're in pain.":"你的专注值有一个自然平衡点。当当前专注值高于或低于自然平衡点时，专注值会逐渐趋向于自然平衡点，偏离越远变化越快。高心情值会提高自然平衡点，低心情值会降低自然平衡点。疼痛也会影响自然平衡点，当你很疼时你会难以进行学习。","Your focus is also lowered by certain activities. Training your skills through real-world practice lowers your focus gradually, by an amount that depends on your current level of focus (higher focus means larger decreases, as well as improved learning). Training your skills by reading books decreases your focus rapidly, by giving a significant penalty to the set point of your focus.":"你的专注值会因为各种行为而降低。当你练习技能的时候会降低你的专注值（专注值越高降低的越快，也同时获得更多的技能经验）。看书学习技能会降低你的专注值的自然平衡点，因此会快速降低你的专注值。","Though it is relatively rare, certain areas of the world may be contaminated with radiation.

Note that most firearms load fully in one action, while shotguns must be loaded one shell at a time.":"(  枪械\n所有的枪械都可以用<%s>键来进行装填，以及用<%s>键来退下子弹，开枪用<%s>键，可以连发的用<%s>来连发。不同枪械的颜色也不同，灰色代表手枪，红色是霰弹枪，蓝绿色的是微型冲锋枪，棕色的是猎枪，蓝色的是突击步枪以及大红色的重机枪。每种枪械都有不同的精确度、伤害值、射速和最大装弹量。需要注意的是虽然大多数的枪械一轮行动都可以装填满，但是霰弹枪一次只能装填一发子弹。","=       Ammunition\nAmmunition is worthless without a gun to load it into.

They are much more difficult to aim and control than larger firearms, and this is reflected in their poor accuracy. However, their small size makes them appropriate for short-range combat, where larger guns fare poorly. They are also relatively quick to reload and use a very wide selection of ammunition. Their small size and low weight make it possible to carry several loaded handguns, switching from one to the next once their ammo is spent.":"<color_ltgray>( 手枪</color>\n手枪，他们虽然体积小，但比起一些大型枪械来可能更难瞄准，不过没关系，因为它们本就设计用来应对近距离的交火，而这是大部分大型枪械所不能胜任的。手枪可以选择的弹药很广泛，并且装填速度也很快，加上它们小巧的体积和重量让你可以备上几把装填完毕的手枪，在需要的时候连着使用。","<color_green>( Crossbows</color>\nThe best feature of crossbows is their silence. The bolts they fire are only rarely destroyed; if you pick up the bolts after firing them, your ammunition supply will last much longer. Crossbows suffer from a short range and a very long reload time (modified by your strength); plus, most only hold a single round. \nFor this reason, it is advisable to carry a few loaded crossbows. Crossbows can be very difficult to find; however, it is possible to craft one given enough Mechanics skill. Likewise, it is possible to make wooden bolts from any number of wooden objects, though these are much less effective than steel bolts. Crossbows use the handgun skill.":"<color_green>( 弩</color>\n弩的最大优点就是无声无息地杀人~并且箭矢在射出之后通常不会被损坏，如果你能养成回收箭矢的好习惯，弩会是一件很趁手的武器。由于使用机械动力，所以十字弓的射程很近，装填时间也很长（你的力气越大，装填越快），并且通常一次只能装填一发箭矢，所以如果可能的话，不妨事先准备好几把上了弹药的弩备用。\n游戏中，弩也是较难获得的武器之一，所以大多数情况下玩家必须自己制作一把，并且几乎所有的木材都能用来制作木制弩矢，你要知道的是游戏中也有更强力的金属弩矢。另外记好，弩使用手枪技能。","<color_yellow>( Bows</color>\nSilent, deadly, easy to make, and the arrows are reusable. Bows have been used forever. Bows are two handed and require the user to have a certain strength level. If you do not have enough strength to draw the string back, you will fire at a reduced effectiveness. This reduces the reload and fire speeds and decreases the range of the arrows fired. \nMost normal bows require strength of at least 8, others require an above average strength of 10, or a significant strength of 12. Bows use the archery skill.":"<color_yellow>( 弓</color>\n无声，致命，易于制造，箭可以重复利用。弓已经被人类使用了不知道多久了。使用弓需要两只手，并且对于使用者的力量有一定要求。如果你没有足够的力量开弓，那么你的射击效率就会掉价。上箭速度，射击速度还有射程都会因此降低。\n大部分普通的弓都需要至少8的力量，其他的一些则需要更强的10点力量，或者更加强大的12的力量。弓使用弓术技能。","<color_red>( Shotguns</color>\nShotguns are some of the most powerful weapons in the game, capable of taking out almost any enemy with a single hit. Birdshot and 00 shot spread, making it very easy to hit nearby monsters. However, they are very ineffective against armor, and some armored monsters might shrug off 00 shot completely. Shotgun slugs are the answer to this problem; they also offer much better range than shot.\nThe biggest drawback to shotguns is their noisiness. They are very loud, and impossible to silence. A shot that kills one zombie might attract three more! Because of this, shotguns are best reserved for emergencies.":"<color_red>( 霰弹枪</color>\n霰弹枪系列是游戏中威力最大的武器之一，使用得当的话，几乎没有敌人可以扛过一枪。猎鸟弹和00弹是散射型的，在近距离很容易击中目标。然而它们的穿甲能力很弱，面对一些重甲的敌人甚至无法造成任何伤害。而使用独头弹则可以解决重甲敌人，而且射程也较远。\n霰弹枪最大的不足之处就是它们的噪音，它们是如此的吵闹以至于每击杀一个敌人，有可能引来更多，所以当你选择使用霰弹枪的时候，请同时做好跑路的准备。","<color_cyan>( Submachine Guns</color>\nSubmachine guns are small weapons (some are barely larger than a handgun), designed for relatively close combat and the ability to spray large amounts of bullets. However, they are more effective when firing single shots, so use discretion. They mainly use the 9mm and .45 ammunition; however, other SMGs exist. They reload moderately quickly, and are suitable for close or medium-long range combat.":"<color_cyan>( 冲锋枪</color>\n微型冲锋枪是小型的枪械（有些甚至比手枪大不了多少），通常以无脑喷射大量子弹来应对近距离的突击，所以比起单发射击来，一口气射出一梭子弹是正确的用法。微型冲锋枪通常使用的是9mm及.45口径的子弹，当然也有例外。微冲的一大特性就是装填相对很快，所以在近程及近—中程的战斗中都会很有用。","<color_brown>( Hunting Rifles</color>\nHunting rifles are popular for their superior range and accuracy. What's more, their scopes or sights make shots fired at targets more than 10 tiles away as accurate as those with a shorter range. However, they are very poor at hitting targets 4 squares or less from the player. Unlike assault rifles, hunting rifles have no automatic fire. They are also slow to reload and fire, so when facing a large group of nearby enemies, they are not the best pick.":"<color_brown>( 猎枪</color>\n猎枪因其优越的射程和精准度而闻名，更确切的说，配上瞄准镜或者金属瞄准具的话，你甚至可以轻松打中10格以外的敌人，然而当敌人突进到4格以内的范围时，猎枪反而变得很难击中敌人，所以要小心。    与突击步枪不同的是，猎枪没有连发的功能，并且他们的装填速度非常慢，所以当你面对大群敌人的时候，有比猎枪更好的选择。","<color_blue>( Assault Rifles</color>\nAssault rifles are similar to hunting rifles in many ways; they are also suited for long range combat, with similar bonuses and penalties. Unlike hunting rifles, assault rifles are capable of automatic fire. Assault rifles are less accurate than hunting rifles, and this is worsened under automatic fire, so save it for when you're highly skilled. \nAssault rifles are an excellent choice for medium or long range combat, or even close-range bursts again a large number of enemies. They are difficult to use, and are best saved for skilled riflemen.":"<color_blue>( 突击步枪</color>\n突击步枪跟猎枪在很多方面有相似之处：都很适合长程的战斗、都受到同样属性的奖惩，而与猎枪不同的是突击步枪可以连发。比起猎枪，突击步枪的精确度会弱一些，而且在连发时更明显，所以最好当你的枪械技能足够高了以后再选择使用突击步枪。\n突击步枪最适合应对中远程的战斗，甚至在近战中也能摞倒一片敌人，但使用它们很讲究技巧，所以嘛，先练好打手枪再回来。","<color_ltred>( Machine Guns</color>\nMachine guns are one of the most powerful firearms available. They are even larger than assault rifles, and make poor melee weapons; however, they are capable of holding 100 or more rounds of highly-damaging ammunition. They are not built for accuracy, and firing single rounds is not very effective. However, they also possess a very high rate of fire and somewhat low recoil, making them very good at clearing out large numbers of enemies.":"<color_ltred>(  机枪</color>\n\n各种机枪是游戏中最强力的一类武器，他们比突击步枪更长更粗更硬，因为很重反而不适合砸人，不过这不是重点，重点是它们可以一次性容纳100发以上的高能弹药，对于机枪来说精确度不是它们的追求，单发射击也不是理想的选择，只要你选择一个方向，架起机枪，就可以向一大群的敌人尽情倾泻弹药，让他们瞬间化成血泥。","<color_magenta>( Energy Weapons</color>\nEnergy weapons is an umbrella term used to describe a variety of rifles and handguns which fire lasers, plasma, or energy attacks. They started to appear in military use just prior to the start of the apocalypse, and as such are very difficult to find.\nEnergy weapons have no recoil at all; they are nearly silent, have a long range, and are fairly damaging. The biggest drawback to energy weapons is scarcity of ammunition; it is wise to reserve the precious ammo for when you really need it.":"<color_magenta>( 能量武器</color>\n能量武器是枪械中的一朵奇葩，从步枪到手枪都有，发射激光、等离子等各种能量，在大灾变之前曾被应用在军事领域，如今已经很难再找到了。\n能量武器的优点很多：完全没有后坐力、几乎是无声的、射程极长并且伤害非常可观，而使用能量武器最大的限制就是弹药非常之稀少，所以能量武器的正确使用方法就是留到最关键的时候。","Q: What is Safe Mode, and why does it prevent me from moving?\nA: Safe Mode is a way to guarantee that you won't die by holding a movement key down. When a monster comes into view, your movement will be ignored until Safe Mode is turned off with the ! key. This ensures that the sudden appearance of a monster won't catch you off guard.":"问：那个\"安全模式\"是干嘛用的？为什么开了反而不能移动了呢？\n答：\"安全模式\"的用意是当你持续按住一个方向键进行跑步的时候，如果视线范围内出现敌人的话，不至于来不及收手而冲进敌群。一旦能看到敌人，你就会自动停下，除非按\"!\"键解除安全模式，否则不会移动。","Q: It seems like everything I eat makes me sick! What's wrong?\nA: Lots of the food found in towns is perishable and will only last a few days after the start of a new game. The electricity went out several days ago so fruit, milk and others are the first to go bad. After the first couple of days, you should switch to canned food, jerky, and hunting. Also, you should make sure to cook any food and purify any water you hunt up as it may contain parasites or otherwise be unsafe.":"问：为什么几乎我吃下去的所有东西都会让我生病？\n答：你懂的，食物放在那里的时候是会逐渐腐坏的，比如水果、牛奶都是最容易坏掉的。而这腐坏的进程从你进入游戏中的第一天就开始了，所以如果你找不到新鲜的水果和牛奶的话，试试不容易腐坏的罐装食品或者打猎吧。而且，你应该确保烹饪所有食物并净化饮水，不然可能会有寄生虫或其他不安全的因素。","Q: How can I remove boards from boarded-up windows and doors?\nA: Use a hammer and choose the direction of the boarded-up window or door to remove the boards.":"问：我要怎样才能封上门窗呢？\n答：你需要一把锤子、一堆钉子、几块板子，然后对着你想要封上的门窗使用就行了。","Q: The game just told me to quit, and other weird stuff is happening.\nA: You have the Schizophrenic trait, which might make the game seem buggy.":"问：游戏通知我将要退出，还有其他很多奇怪的事。\n答：你选取了精神分裂症的特征，这可能使游戏看起来出现了bug。","Q: How can I prevent monsters from attacking while I sleep?\nA: Find a safe place to sleep, for example in a cleared building far from the front door. Set traps if you have them, or build a fire.":"问：睡觉的时候怎样才能防止被怪物侵袭？\n答：首先建议你选个安全的地方睡觉，比如建筑物内远离出入口的地方，在身边设几个陷阱然后再生一堆火，这样基本就OK了。","Q: Why do I always sink when I try to swim?\nA: Your swimming ability is reduced greatly by the weight you are carrying, and is also adversely affected by the clothing you wear. Until you reach a high level of the swimming skill, you'll need to drop your equipment and remove your clothing to swim, making it a last-ditch escape plan.":"问：为什么我游泳的时候总是会沉下去啊？\n答：你携带了太多东西，所以你的游泳能力被大幅降低了，而且你穿的衣服也会影响你的游泳能力。在你把游泳技能练得出神入化之前，要下水，最好扔掉所有的装备，然后脱光光。游泳是你最后不得已的逃生手段。","Q: How can I cure a fungal infection?\nA: Royal jelly, the Blood Filter bionic, and some antifungal chemicals can cure fungal infection. You can find royal jelly in the bee hives which dot forests. Antifungal chemicals to cure the fungal infection can either be found as random loot or made from other ingredients.":"问：如何才能治愈真菌感染？\n答：蜂王浆，血液过滤CBM，或者其他一些抗真菌化合物。你在以在丛林中点缀的蜂巢里找到蜂王浆，而抗真菌化合物则可以搜刮得来，也可以按照特定配方制造。","Q: How do I get into science labs?\nA: You can enter the front door if you have an ID card by examining (%s) the keypad. If you are skilled in computers and have an electrohack, it is possible to hack the keypad. An EMP blast has a chance to force the doors open, but it's more likely to break them. You can also sneak in through the sewers sometimes, or try to smash through the walls with explosions.":"问：我该如何进入一个科学实验室呢？\n答：如果你有ID卡的话从正门刷卡（%s ）进去就是了；如果你的电脑技术够高并且有一套黑客设备，你也可以黑开大门；如果你有EMP武器，也有可能暂时使大门失效，但更有可能毁掉大门；或者你可以试着从下水道等地方潜入实验室；甚至你也可以直接用炸药把实验室的墙壁炸开。","Q: Why does my crafting fail so often?\nA: Check the difficulty of the recipe, and the primary skill used; your skill level should be around one and a half times the difficulty to be confident that it will succeed.":"问：为什么想制作些物品那么难呢？\n答：检查一下配方的难度等级，你的技能等级需要在标识的难度等级的1.5倍以上才容易成功。","Q: Why can't I carry anything?\nA: At the start of the game you only have the space in your pockets. A good first goal of many survivors is to find a backpack or pouch to store things in. (The shelter basement is a good place to check first!)":"问：我怎么拿不了东西了？\n答：在游戏一开始，你只有衣服有口袋可以装几个道具而已。随着游戏的进行，你可以在商店或者其他地方找到背包或者钱包，从而可以携带更多的物品。（游戏开始时，你应该先去紧急避难所的地下室去搜集东西！）","Q: Shotguns bring in more zombies than they kill!  What's the point?\nA: Shotguns are intended for emergency use. If you are cornered, use your shotgun to escape, then just run from the zombies it attracts.":"问：为什么用霰弹枪打丧尸的时候，引来的数量远比打死的多？搞什么呀？\n答：霰弹枪虽然威力巨大但噪音也很大，所以如果你被敌人逼在墙角的时候，可以用它来突围，然后迅速逃之夭夭。","Q: Help! I started a fire and now my house is burning down!\nA: Fires will spread to nearby flammable tiles if they are able. Lighting a fire in a set-up brazier, stove, wood stove, stone fireplace, or pit will stop it from spreading. Fire extinguishers can put out fires that get out of control.":"问：救命啊！我点了把火不小心把房子给烧了！\n答：火势会随着周围的易燃物和天花板蔓延，你可以在周围放火盆、木炉、石炉，或者挖坑来阻止它的蔓延，如果你被大火包围，那么灭火器可以帮你突出重围。","Q: I'm cold and can't sleep at night!\nA: Gather some clothes and put them in the place you use to sleep in. Being hungry, thirsty, wet, or injured can also make you feel the cold more, so try to avoid these effects before you go to sleep.":"问：我晚上冻的睡不着！\n答：收集一些衣服什么的，把它们扔在你要睡觉的地方。饥饿，口渴，淋湿，或者受伤都会让你觉得更冷，所以在睡觉前尽量不要处于这些状态。","Q: I have a question that's not addressed here.

We entered the complex with two dozen men and immediately went about securing this control room.  From here I dispatched my men to secure vital systems located on this floor and the floors below this one.  If  we are successful, this facility can be cleared and used as a permanent base of operations in the region.  Most importantly it will allow us to redirect refugee traffic away from overcrowded outposts and free up more of our forces to conduct recovery operations.":"我带领了我们团队剩下的人马来重新控制这一设施。我们两打队员进入了一个复杂的地区，然后立刻前往确保控制室。在哪里我派了些人去守护这一层和下一层的关键系统。如果我们成功了的话，这个设施就可以作为我们这个团队的永久基地了。最重要的是这里可以让我们从一些过于拥挤的避难所里分流一部分难民，同时相关的工作人员也可以从中释放以从事其它修复工作。","This facility was constructed to provide a safe haven in the event of a global conflict.  The vault can support several thousand people for a few years if all systems are operational and sufficient notification is given.  Unfortunately, the power system was damaged or sabotaged at some point and released a single extremely lethal burst of radiation.  The catastrophic event lasted for several minutes and resulted in the deaths of most people located on the 2nd and lower floors.  Those working on this floor were able to seal the access ways to the lower floors before succumbing to radiation sickness.  The only other thing the logs tell us is that all water pressure was diverted to the lower levels.":"这一设施主要是作为产生了全球范围的军事冲突之后，作为提供一个安全的庇护所来建造的。这个地洞可以提供几千人在这里生活上几年，如果所有设备都正常运作并且有专人控制的话。这里的供电系统已经在哪里损坏或者被蓄意破坏过了，会释放出一堆带有致死能量的极强电磁辐射。这一灾难性事件使得在这里2层和更低层的人们在几分钟之内全部死于非命。而那些在这一层工作的人们通过封死了通往下层的通道而逃过了辐射的伤害。而这一报告也说出了另外的情况，下层空间已经被水压涌入淹没。","Marshal, I'm rather surprised to see you here.":"执法官，能在这看到你真令人惊讶。","Sir you are not authorized to be here... you should leave.":"先生，您没有这里的授权……请离开。","Ma'am you are not authorized to be here... you should leave.":"女士，您没有这里的授权……请离开。","We are securing the external communications array for this facility.  I'm rather restricted in what I can release... go find my commander if you have any questions.":"我们正在保卫这座设施的外部通讯阵列。我受限不能透露太多信息……如果你有任何问题，去找我的指挥官。","I was expecting the captain to send a runner.  Here is the list you are looking for.  What we can identify from here are simply the frequencies that have traffic on them.  Many of the transmissions are indecipherable without repairing or replacing the equipment here.  When the facility was being overrun, standard procedure was to destroy encryption hardware to protect federal secrets and maintain the integrity of the comms network.  We are hoping a few plain text messages can get picked up though.":"我本希望上尉能派来一个跑腿的。 这是你要的频率表。从这份表里我们只能看到那些曾经有通讯过的频率， 但这些通讯大多都加密了，不修复或者替换这里的设备是没法破译的。当初设施被侵占了，按标准流程来说应该破坏加密用的硬件，以此来保护联邦政府机密和保持通讯网络的完整，虽然我们还希望收到些明文报文。","Hope you're here to trade.":"希望你来这里是来交易的。","I oversee the food stocks for the center.  There was significant looting during the panic when we first arrived so most of our food was carried away.  I manage what we have left and do everything I can to increase our supplies.  Rot and mold are more significant in the damp basement so I prioritize non-perishable food, such as cornmeal, jerky, and fruit wine.":"我管理这个中心的食物库存。在我们刚到达时的一片混乱之中，大部分食物都被带走了。而我负责管理剩下的食物并且尽可能的增加库存。潮湿的地下室中很容易发霉变质，所以我更倾向于易于保存的食物，比如玉米面，肉干，果子酒。","All three are easy to locally produce in significant quantities and are non-perishable.  We have a local farmer or two and a few hunter types that have been making attempts to provide us with the nutritious supplies.  We do always need more suppliers though.  Because this stuff is rather cheap in bulk I can pay a premium for any you have on you.  Canned food and other edibles are handled by the merchant in the front.":"这三种很容易大量生产而且不容易变质。我们当地的农夫及一些猎人能够提供我们一些营养的补给，但我们还是需要更多。因为这东西是相当便宜大量的，只要你有的话，我可以付给你特别价格。罐头食品及其他的食物是由前面的商人处理。","I'm actually accepting a number of different foodstuffs: beer, sugar, flour, smoked meat, smoked fish, cooking oil; and as mentioned before, jerky, cornmeal, and fruit wine.":"我的确接受许多不同的食品：啤酒，糖，面粉，熏肉，熏鱼，烹调油；还有刚才说的，玉米面，肉干，果子酒。","Pleasure doing business!":"交易愉快！","Can I help you marshal?":"有什么我可以效劳的吗，长官？","Morning sir, how can I help you?":"早上好，先生，我能帮你什么忙吗？","Morning ma'am, how can I help you?":"早上好，女士，我能帮你什么忙吗？","I was starting to wonder if they were really interested in the project or were just trying to get rid of me.":"我开始怀疑他们是不是真的对这项目感兴趣，或者只是在试图摆脱我。","Ya, that representative from the Old Guard asked the two of us to come out here and begin fortifying this place as a refugee camp.  I'm not sure how fast he expects the two of us to get setup but we were assured additional men were coming out here to assist us. ":"没错，那个旧世守护者的人带我们来这儿加固这个地方，打算建成一个新的难民营。我不清楚他想让我们多久搞定，但我听说会有额外的人手来帮忙。 ","Could easily be hundreds as far as I know.  They chose this ranch because of its rather remote location, decent fence, and huge cleared field.  With as much land as we have fenced off we could build a village if we had the materials.  We would have tried to secure a small town or something but the lack of good farmland and number of undead makes it more practical for us to build from scratch.  The refugee center I came from is constantly facing starvation and undead assaults.":"要做的事怎么说也有成百上千。 他们选择这个牧场，因为位置比较偏远，栅栏也挺完整，还有大片的空地。 这么一大块栅栏围住的土地，只要再搞到些建材，我们可以建起一座村庄。原本我们想占据一个现成的小镇之类的地方，但耕种用地的匮乏和丧尸们的热情访问让我们明白，还是从头开始建设更来得实际。我原来呆的难民中心就一直在面临着饥荒和丧尸攻击的问题。","I'm the engineer in charge of turning this place into a working camp.  This is going to be an uphill battle, we used most of our initial supplies getting here and boarding up the windows.  I've got a huge list of tasks that need to get done so if you could help us keep supplied I'd appreciate it.  If you have material to drop off you can just back your vehicle into here and dump it on the ground, we'll sort it.":"我是负责把这个地方变成一个工作营地的工程师。这会是件棘手的事情，因为抵达这里时我们几乎耗尽了补给，而封死所有的窗户又差不多用光了我们的材料。可我还有一堆数都数不清的活要做，所以如果你能给我们提供一些补给品我简直愿意以身相许。只要你有任何能运来的材料，把车开进来，把东西一股脑卸在地上就行。剩下的就交给我们吧。","My partner is in charge of fortifying this place, you should ask him about what needs to be done.":"我的搭档负责加固这个地方，你可以问问他有什么要做的。","Howdy.":"哈喽。","I was among one of the first groups of immigrants sent here to fortify the outpost.  I might have exaggerated my construction skills to get the hell out of the refugee center.  Unless you are a trader there isn't much work there and food was really becoming scarce when I left.":"我是被派来加固哨站的第一批移民之一。为了离开难民中心，我可能稍稍夸大了一点我的建造技能……你懂的，我离开的时候那儿已经不剩多少食物了。恐怕这里没什么活给你，除非你有什么能交易的东西。","You need something?":"有何需求？","I'm one of the migrants that got diverted to this outpost when I arrived at the refugee center.  They said I was big enough to swing an ax so my profession became lumberjack... didn't have any say in it.  If I want to eat then I'll be cutting wood from now till kingdom come.":"我一到难民营就被分派来这个哨站。他们说我的块头非常适合挥斧头，所以我就变成了个伐木工……我连说不的机会都没。如果我不想挨饿，我就得一直砍木头砍到下辈子。","Come back later, I need to take care of a few things first.":"现在我有点事要做，待会再来吧。","The rate is a bit steep but I still have my quotas that I need to fulfill.  The logs will be dropped off in the garage at the entrance to the camp.  I'll need a bit of time before I can deliver another load.":"开价可能是高了点儿，但要知道，我还有硬指标要完成呢！我会把原木放在营地门口的车库里。每次完工之前我都需要些时间，别太急。","Don't have much time to talk.":"我可没多少时间聊天。","I turn the logs that laborers bring in into lumber to expand the outpost.  Maintaining the saw is a chore but breaks the monotony.":"我会把伐木工人们砍下来放在这里的原木转运加工成木材，然后作为前哨站扩建的材料。保养木锯锯条是我现在份内的工作中最不无聊的工作了，因为我可以一个锯齿一个锯齿地数到天黑。","Bringing in logs is one of the few tasks we can give to the unskilled so I'd be hurting them if I outsourced it.  Ask around though, I'm sure most people could use a hand.":"我不想让新手受伤，所以让你们带些原木回来就是我为数不多的选择之一。不过你们可以在附近问问，我相信很多人需要帮忙的。","I was sent here to assist in setting-up the farm.  Most of us have no real skills that transfer from before the cataclysm so things are a bit of trial and error.":"我是被派过来帮忙建设农场的。我们大多数人在末世之前都没学过相关的知识，所以我们现在是在尝试和错误中努力前行。","I'm sorry, I don't have anything to trade.  The work program here splits what we produce between the refugee center, the farm, and ourselves.  If you are a skilled laborer then you can trade your time for a bit of extra income on the side.
